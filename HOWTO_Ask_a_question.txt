How to ask a question
---------------------
Since HPC is a research cluster, it is in perpetual flux as hardware, apps, libraries, and modules
are added, updated, and/or modified so often a bug will creep in where none existed before.  When
you find something missing or a behavior that seems odd, please let us know.  You can
mailto:hpc-support@uci.edu?Subject=HPC:[email the HPC admins here].

Note that it will help considerably if you tell us more than 'It doesn't work', or 'I can't log
in'.  If you want quick resolution of the problem, please send us as much relevant info as
possible, including a description of 'what triggered the misbehavior'.  For us to help you, *we have
to be able to re-create the problem*, so include the commandline you used, including all the
options, the input and output file paths and preferably the command prompt which should include the
node from which it was issued, and the time.

If the misbehavior involves an error message, doing a Google search on *that error message* 
will often produce the answer. (see
http://moo.nac.uci.edu/~hjm/FixITYourselfWithGoogle.html[Fix IT yourself with Google].

While many of you are not programmers, you're dealing with programs, and if we are to have any hope
of debugging the process that caused the failure, the more info the better (usually).  PLEASE READ
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html[How to Report Bugs Effectively] before you
report a failure.  At least glance at it.

If you're going to spend a lot of time with computers, you should also read Eric Raymond's
encyclopedic http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html[How To Ask Questions The Smart
Way].   It will be of use thru your life, not only for computers, but in many other domains as well.

[[offcampus]]
== Access to HPC
Access to HPC is blocked from off-campus for security reasons. From off-campus, 
you have to use a 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network[Virtual Private Network] connection.
See http://www.oit.uci.edu/vpn/[UCI's VPN Web page] for more information 
and to download the required VPN client software.  Or you can first ssh to an unblocked
machine that's on the UCI network, THEN connect to HPC.

[[localsupport]]
== Local Computer Support
Note that many such login problems are due to your local hardware and software 
configurations.  If you have a local computer support person, s/he may be able to 
help you faster than we can.  
http://www.oit.uci.edu/help/csc/[Here is a list of such Computer Support People].

[[infoweneed]]
== The minimum information we need

=== If it's a login problem:

- where are you trying to log in FROM (from campus? from UHills? from Kansas?). If from
offcampus, link:#offcampus[see above].
- what kind of computer and Operating System you're connecting from is often useful, 
 especially for connection-related problems.
- what software are you using to connect and which version?
- what command did you use (*exactly*)?
- what was the error message (*exactly*)?
- what did you find when you searched https://www.google.com/[Google] with that error message?

=== If the error occurred on HPC:
Please include this information:

- the directory in which you're working ('pwd', if it's not in your prompt (see 
link:#usefulprompt[below]))
- the *FULL PATH* of files that you reference.  HPC has a huge file search space, even
for a single user.
- the machine  or node you're working on ('hostname', if it's not in your prompt')
- the modules you've loaded ('module list')
- the version of the software can also be useful.
- the command you used (*exactly*) or if it was caused by a script, the *full path* to the script.
- Break long commands into readable length with the use of the continuation 
character "\".  ie: instead of one continuous line which will cause line breaks randomly:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 $ make_2d_plots.py -i wetdry_cr/beta_diveuclidean/beta_div_euclideancoords.txt -m wetdry_cr/mapping_files/merged_mapping_data.txt -b 'Elevation' -o wetdry_cr/2dplots/elevation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- format it like this, which shows how the arguments are called, with the matching
filenames:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 $ make_2d_plots.py \
   -i wetdry_cr/beta_diveuclidean/beta_div_euclideancoords.txt \
   -m wetdry_cr/mapping_files/merged_mapping_data.txt \
   -b 'Elevation' \
   -o wetdry_cr/2dplots/elevation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- include the error that it caused (*exactly*), including the full path to the error files  
if they were generated. SGE will drop error files in your $HOME dir named '
"<SGE_NAME>.e<JOBID>"'.  You might also examine the contents of those files 
before you call for help.
- If the error was more than a few lines, copy/paste them into http://pastebin.com/[pastebin] 
(or an http://www.techtricksworld.com/what-is-pastebin-10-pastebin-alternatives/[alternative] 
and include the link generated rather than the pages of output. (Obviously, don't include sensitive
information in public 'pastes'.)
- copy the 'TEXT of the command and output' if possible. DO NOT send us a 
screenshot of the commands unless you're using a graphics program and the problem 
is more succinctly described with a screenshot (reason: it's harder to copy text from a screenshot.
- much of this info can be automatically generated by a decent prompt and it also helps YOU by
letting YOU know where you are (on what machine, in what dir).  

[[usefulprompt]]
=== Make your  prompt useful
If you add one of the following *PS1* lines to your '~/.bashrc', it will speed 
things up because you can just copy your prompt to supply a lot of the needed info:

----------------------------------------------------------
# the colorless short version that creates a prompt like this:

# Thu Mar 20 14:48:47 hjm@stunted:~/Downloads
# 522 $

PS1="\n\d \t \u@\h:\w\n \! \$ "

# the colorful longer version that creates a prompt like this:

# Thu Mar 20 12:08:38 [0.68 0.70 0.64]  hjm@stunted:~/nacs
# 556 $

PS1="\n\[\033[01;34m\]\d \t \[\033[00;33m\][\$(cat /proc/loadavg | cut -f1,2,3 -d' ')] \
 \[\033[01;32m\]\u@\[\033[01;31m\]\h:\[\033[01;35m\]\w\n\! \$ \[\033[00m\]"
----------------------------------------------------------
The above looks like this on a black background:
image:long-color-bash-prompt.png[long color bash prompt] +
where the numbers in the brackets indicate the [1m, 5m, & 10m] system load average, which is also
useful for debugging problems.

== Make sure that ...

- You're on the right machine.  This is why we want the information about which machine you're on.
- the files you're using have not been corrupted during transfer.  This is frequently the problem
when transferring files from Windows machines with applications that do not do 
automatic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline[newline] conversion.  Use the 'file' 
command to check whether there are DOS newlines.

== Frequent mistakes

=== Wrong machine
People new to HPC often confuse which machine they are working on, especially
if they are using a Mac.  This is why we want the information about which 
machine shows up in your prompt. link:#usefulprompt[See above].

=== DOS newlines
Check that your input files don't have https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline[DOS newlines].
    Use the 'file' utility to examine the files.  
----------------------------------------------------------
$ file /path/to/suspect_file.txt 
/path/to/suspect_file.txt : ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators

# If output contains the phrase above:  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# then it needs to be converted to Linux newlines with 'dos2unix'

$ dos2unix /path/to/suspect.txt
$ file /path/to/suspect.txt
/path/to/suspect.txt: ASCII text
----------------------------------------------------------

=== Forgetting 'module load'

All applications in the 'module' system have to be set up by requesting 
HPC's module system do so so. So if you wanted to run R, version 3.2.1, you would 
have to enter the module command:

*module load R/3.2.1*

At that point the environment for that version of R is set up and you can start *R*
in the usual way:

*R*

Note that omitting the version number will load the *numerically highest* version available
which is often NOT the latest version since many versioning schemes use non-numerically 
increasing series. It's safest to be explicit which version you want.
