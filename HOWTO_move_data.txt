Executive Summary
-----------------
If you have to transfer data, transfer only link:#rsync[that which is necessary].
If you unavoidably have TBs to transfer regularly, consider having your
institution set up a link:#gridftp[GridFTP] node.

// or use [Globus Connect MultiUser] (GCM).

If link:#gridftp[GridFTP] is not available, a very easy user-side transfer approach
is using a 
link:#globusonline[Globus Online] endpoint.  However, this now seems to require data providers
to license the technology.  Depending on cost relative to Globus, link:#aspera[Aspera] may be
very effective as well, providing extremely fast data transfer, albeit requiring a licensed
server.  The fastest, easiest, user-mode, node-to-node method (that remains free) 
to move data for Linux and MacOSX is with link:#bbcp[bbcp].  Note that it is quite sensitive
to tuning which may limit its ease for naive users.
An exception is for extremely large directory trees for which 'bbcp' is inefficient due to 
time required for building the directory tree.  In that case, 'rsync' may be an easier 
choice, although 'bbcp' offers a named-pipe option which can use an external app to 
do the recursive operation. link:#lftp[lftp] is a less sophisticated, but more 
widely available alternative to bbcp.

For first-time transfers of multi-GB directory trees containing 10,000s of files, 
the use of link:#tarnetcat['tar' & netcat] seems to be the fastest way to move the data.

If you use Windows, link:#fdt[fdt] is Java-based and will run there as well.

Note that bbcp and the similar link:#bbftp[bbftp] can require considerable tuning 
to extract maximum bandwidth.
If these applications do not work at expected rates, ESNet's
http://fasterdata.es.net/assets/fasterdata/JT-201010.pdf[Guide to Bulk Data 
Transfer over a WAN] is an
excellent summary of the deeper network issues. (Thanks to 'Rob Wells' for 
the link change info.)

And everyone should know how to use link:#rsync[rsync], which is available on
most *nix sytems and should be the default fallback for most data transfers. 
A perl wrapper for it, http://moo.nac.uci.edu/~hjm/parsync/parsyncfp[parsyncfp] 
will load-balance and fork multiple instances of it to increase bandwidth utilization.


== Big Bytes across the network

We all need to transfer data, and the amount of that data is increasing as the 
world gets more digital.  If it's not climate model data from the IPCC, it's 
high energy particle physics data from the LHC, or audio & video streams from a 
performance recording.

The usual methods of transferring data (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy[scp], 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http[http] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ftp[ftp] 
utilities (such as http://curl.haxx.se/[curl] or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget[wget]) 
work fine when your data is in the MB range, but when you have very large collections 
of data there are some tricks that are worth mentioning.


[[zotfile]]
.A note about transferring Zillions Of Tiny (ZOT) files
[NOTE]
=======================================================
Altho much 'big data' is showing up in very large files (10s or 1000s of GB each),
there is a lot of traffic in small files, often generated by naive users who are
creating many (10s of millions) such files in a single analytical run.

It's worth a few words about the size and number of files.  A file on a disk is
characterized not only by its contents but by the file descriptor itself.  Each
file requires the lookup and examination of an inode structure to find out where
the disk blocks of that file are kept.  Obviously if you have 1GB of data in 1
file, it will be accessible much more quickly than if you have to look up 1
million files of 1000 bytes each.  This has implications when you're
transferring data on an active system.  You want to transfer the maximum data
with the minimum overhead, so if your files are large, it will transfer more
rapidly.  Here's an example.

A Mail dir on my laptop contains 95MB of information in 32,304 files and dirs.
It takes 12s to move to a remote server over 1GbE when being copied file by
file.  It takes about 3s to store all the files and dirs in an uncompressed tar
file but then takes only 5s for the single file that contains all that data to
transfer to the same server over the same connection. This difference is
accentuated as the number of files increases and the network hop-count
increases.

The more data you can pack into fewer files, the faster your transfer will be.
Obviously if it's a few files over a private, fast attached filesystem, it won't
be significant, but when you're moving ZOT files over a Wide Area Network or
even across networked filesystems, it can make a huge difference.

=======================================================


[[comp_encrypt]]
Compression & Encryption
------------------------
Whether to compress and/or encrypt your data in transit depends on the cost of doing so.  For a modern desktop or laptop computer, the CPU(s) are usually not doing much of anything so the cost incurred in doing the compression/encryption is generally not even noticed. However on an otherwise loaded machine, it can be significant, so it depends on what has to be done at the same time.  Compression can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted considerably if the data is of a type that is compressible (text, XML, uncompressed images and music), however progressively such data is already compressed on the disk (in the form of jpeg or mp3 compression), and compressing already compressed data yields little improvement.  Some compression utilities try to detect already-compressed data and skip it, so there's often no penalty in requesting compression, but some utilities (like the popular Linux archiving tar) will not detect it correctly and waste lots of time trying.

As an extreme example, here's the timing of making a tar archive of a large directory that consists of mostly already compressed data, using compression or not.

*Using* compression:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
$ time tar -czpf /bduc/data.tar.gz /data
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names

real    201m38.540s
user    95m32.114s
sys     7m13.807s

tar file = 84,284,016,900 bytes
-------------------------------------------------------------------

*NOT using* compression:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
$ time tar -cpf /bduc/data.tar /data
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names

real    127m13.404s
user    0m43.579s
sys     5m35.437s

tar file = 86,237,952,000
-------------------------------------------------------------------
It took more than 74 minutes (about 58%) longer using compression which gained us about 2GB less storage (2.3% decrease in size.) YMMV.


.Parallel compression/decompression
[NOTE]
===========================================================================

There are now parallel compression/decompresion routines that will, for large files, help substantially, by using all the available CPU cores to do the compression.

From the same author as 'gzip' comes http://zlib.net/pigz/[pigz/unpigz]
(probably already in your repository) that is a near-drop-in replacement for
gzip/gunzip.  Similarly there is a http://compression.ca/pbzip2/[parallel bzip2
engine called pbzip2] that is a near-drop-in replacement for 'bzip2'.  For very
large jobs there is also an http://compression.ca/mpibzip2/[MPI-capable bzip2
utility].  The 'pigz' compression accelerates on a per-file basis, so
compressing ZOT files will not give you much of a speedup, but if you pass large
files thru 'pigz', you'll get close-to-perfect scaling.

===========================================================================

Similarly, there is a computational cost to encrypting and decrypting a text,
but less so than with compression.  'scp' uses 'ssh' to do the underlying
encryption and it does a very good job, but like the other single-TCP-stream
utilities like 'curl' and 'wget', it will only be able to push so much thru a
connection.

[[avoiding]]
Avoiding data transfer
----------------------
The most efficient way to transfer data is not to transfer it at all.  There are a number of utilities that can be used to assist in NOT transferring data.  Some of them are listed below.

[[kdirstat]]
kdirstat
~~~~~~~~
The elegant, open source http://kdirstat.sourceforge.net/[kdirstat] (and it's
ports to MacOSX http://www.derlien.com/[Disk Inventory X] and Windows
http://windirstat.info/[Windirstat]) are quick ways to visualize what's taking
up space on your disk so you can either exclude the unwanted data that needs to
be copied or delete it to make more space.  All of these are fully native GUI
applications that show disk space utilization by file type and directory
structure.

[[rsync]]
rsync
~~~~~
http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync[rsync], from the fertile mind of Andrew (http://www.samba.org/samba/[samba]) Tridgell, is an application that will synchronize 2 directory trees, transferring only blocks which are different.

The open source rsync is included by default with almost all Linux and MacOSX distributions. Versions of rsync exist for Windows as well, via http://www.cygwin.com[Cygwin],  http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp[DeltaCopy], and others.


[NOTE]
.rsync vs bbcp
============================================================================
link:#bbcp[bbcp] can act similarly to 'rsync' but will only checksum entire files,
not blocks, so for sub-GB transfers, 'rsync' is probably a better choice in general.
For very large files or directory trees, 'bbcp' may be a better choice due to its
multi-stream protocol and therefore better bandwidth utilization.

Note also that 'rsync' is often used with 'ssh' as the remote shell protocol. If
this is the case and you're using it to transfer large amounts of data, note
that there is an old known 'ssh' bug with the static flow control buffers that
cripples it for large data transfers.  There is a well-maintained patch for
'ssh' that addresses this at the
http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/hpn-ssh/[High Performance SSH/SCP] page.
This is well worth checking if you use 'rsync' or 'scp' for large transfers.
============================================================================

For example, if you had recently added some songs to your 120 GB MP3 collection and you wanted to refresh the collection to your backup machine, instead of sending the entire collection over the network, rsync would detect and send only the new songs.

For example, the first time rsync is used to transfer a directory tree, there will be no speedup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

but a few minutes later after adding 'danish_wind_industry.html' to the 'FF' directory

-------------------------------------------------------------------
$ rsync -av ~/FF moo:~

sent 63294 bytes  received 48 bytes  126684.00 bytes/sec
total size is 354971578  speedup is 5604.05
-------------------------------------------------------------------

So the synchronization has a speedup of 5600-fold relative to the initial transfer.

Even more efficiently, if you had a huge database to back up and you had recently modified it so that most of the bits were identical, rsync would send only the blocks that contained the differences.

Here's a modest example using a small binary database file:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
$ rsync -av mlocate.db moo:~
building file list ... done
mlocate.db

sent 13580195 bytes  received 42 bytes  9053491.33 bytes/sec
total size is 13578416  speedup is 1.00
--------------------------------------------------------------------

After the transfer, I update the database and rsync it again:

------------------------------------------------------------------
$ rsync -av mlocate.db moo:~
building file list ... done
mlocate.db

sent 632641 bytes  received 22182 bytes  1309646.00 bytes/sec
total size is 13614982  speedup is 20.79
-------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many utilities based on rsync that are used to synchronize data on 2 sides of a connection by only transmitting the differences. The backup utility http://backuppc.sf.net[BackupPC] is one.

http://moo.nac.uci.edu/~hjm/parsync/parsyncfp[parsyncfp] can increase the speed of transfer by load-balancing and parallelizing the transfer.  Especially if there is an imbalance in the disk speed or network, you can use parsync to optimize the transfer, while still limiting the system load on the transmitting host and network.

[[filepart]]
[NOTE]
.File Partitioning Utilities
============================================================================
For this kind of load-balancing, 2 utilities should be noted:

* http://sourceforge.net/projects/fpart/[fpart], a file partitioning tool collects
file info and divides them into N 'chunkfiles', based on a number of criteria.
The author of fpart Ganael LAPLANCHE mailto:ganael.laplanche@martymac.org[Ganael LaPlanche]
has written a very good article:
http://connect.ed-diamond.com/GNU-Linux-Magazine/GLMF-164/Parallelisez-vos-transferts-de-fichiers[PARALLÉLISEZ FILE TRANSFERS] describing many of the problems (and some good solutions) about large-scale data transfer.
This article is in French, but Google does a decent job in translating.
* https://github.com/thomas-joiner/k4dirstat/blob/master/kdirstat/kdirstat-cache-writer[kdirstat-cache-writer],
included with and used by the fabulous http://kdirstat.sourceforge.net/[kdirstat],
which is a directory recursion tool that gathers size info about all the files in a tree.
This was used in the first version of the above-mentioned 'parsync' to balance the transfer load, until I switched to
the fpart partitioner, above.

[[secondrsyncexample]]
As above but also to:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Command to:

- compress files in transit ('-z' but see the link:#comp_encrypt[note above about compression])
- delete the local files when transferred ('--remove-source-files')
- perform the rsync in the background (&) (http://goo.gl/oJYeXD[if you have ssh keys set up])
- capture the activity in a log file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
# the following 'touch' command freshens the date on all C source files in that dir
$ touch tacg-4.6.0-src/*.c

# generate a datestamp, so a second log doesn't overwrite the previous one
$ DD=`date +"%T_%F" | sed 's/:/./g'`

# !! VERY IMPORTANT !!  The following command DELETES ALL THE FILES in the local (HPC-side) dir tree
# (tho it does leave the tree structure behind).  If you don't want to delete the local files,
# don't include the option '--remove-source-files'

$ rsync -avz --remove-source-files tacg-4.6.0-src  happy@circus.tent.uci.edu:~/HPC-backups \

-------------------------------------------------------------------



[NOTE]
.MacOSX
============================================================================
rsync is included with MacOSX as well but because of the Mac's twisted history of using the using the  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleSingle[AppleSingle/AppleDouble] file format (remember those http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork[Resource fork] problems?), the version of rsync (2.6.9) shipped with OSX versions up to 'Leopard' will not handle older Mac-native files correctly. However, rsync version 3.x 'will' apparently do the conversions correctly.
============================================================================




[[unison]]
Unison
~~~~~~
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/[Unison] is a slightly different take on transmitting only changes.  It uses a bi-directional sync algorithm to 'unify' filesystems across a network.  Native versions exist for Windows as well as Linux/Unix and it is usually available from the standard Linux repositories.

From a Ubuntu or Debian machine, to install it would require:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo apt-get install unison
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[streaming]]
Streaming Data Transfer
-----------------------

[[bbcp]]
bbcp
~~~~
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/[bbcp] seems to be a very similar utility to link:#bbftp[bbftp below], with the exception that it does not require a remote server running. In this behavior, it's much more like 'scp' in that data transfer requires only user-executable copies (preferably the same version) on both sides of the connection.  Short of access to a GridFTP site, 'bbcp' appears to be the fastest, most convenient single-node method for transferring data.

.bbcp does not encrypt the data stream
[NOTE]
========================================================================
Unless you use an external encryption utility via bbcp's link:#namedpipes[named pipes] option,
bbcp does 'not' encrypt the data stream.  It uses ssh to set up the authentication but not
to encrypt the data stream.  You can use a utility like http://ccrypt.sourceforge.net/[ccrypt]
to encrypt/decrypt the network stream. Thanks to Dennis Yang for pointing this out.
========================================================================

The author, mailto:abh@stanford.edu[Andrew Hanushevsky] has made a number of
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/%7eabh/bbcp/bin/[precompiled  binaries available] as well as access to the 'bbcp git tree': *git clone http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/bbcp.git*
Somebody at Caltech has written up http://pcbunn.cithep.caltech.edu/bbcp/using_bbcp.htm[a very nice bbcp HOWTO].

The code compiled & installed easily with one manual intervention
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
curl http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/bbcp.tgz |tar -xzf -
cd bbcp
make

# edit Makefile to change line 18 to: LIBZ       =  /usr/lib/libz.a
make
# there is no *install* stanza in the distributed 'Makefile'
cp bin/your_arch/bbcp ~/bin   # if that's where you store your personal bins.
hash -r   # or 'rehash' if using cshrc
# bbcp now ready to use.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'bbcp' can act very much like 'scp' for simple usage:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ time bbcp  file.633M   user@remotehost.subnet.uci.edu:/high/perf/raid/file
real    0m9.023s
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file transferred in under 10s for a 633MB file, giving >63MB/s on a Gb net.  Note that this is over our very fast internal campus backbone. That's pretty good, but the transfer rate is sensitive to a number of things and can be tuned considerably.  If you look at http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/[all the bbcp options], it's obvious that 'bbcp' was written to handle lots of exceptions.

If you increase the number of streams (-s) from the default 4 (as above), you can squeeze a bit more bandwidth from it as well:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ bbcp -P 10 -w 2M -s 10 file.4.2G hjm@remotehost.subnet.uci.edu:/userdata/hjm/
bbcp: Creating /userdata/hjm/file.4.2G
bbcp: At 081210 12:48:18 copy 20% complete; 89998.2 KB/s
bbcp: At 081210 12:48:28 copy 41% complete; 89910.4 KB/s

bbcp: At 081210 12:48:48 copy 80% complete; 88499.3 KB/s
bbcp: At 081210 12:48:58 copy 96% complete; 84571.9 KB/s
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
or almost 85MB/s for 4.2GB which is very good sustained transfer.

Even traversing the CENIC net from UCI to SDSC is fairly good:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ time bbcp -P 2 -w 2M -s 10 file.633M   user@machine.sdsc.edu:~/test.file

bbcp: Source I/O buffers (61440K) > 25% of available free memory (200268K); copy may be slow

bbcp: At 081205 14:24:48 copy 96% complete; 28454.3 KB/s

real    0m26.965s
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
or almost 30MB/s.

When making the above test, I noticed the disks to and from which the data was being written can have a large effect on the transfer rate.  If the data is not (or cannot be) cached in RAM, the transfer will eventually require the data to be read from or written to the disk.  Depending on the storage system, this may slow the eventual transfer if the disk I/O cannot keep up with the the network.  On the systems that I used in the example above, I saw this effect when I transferred the data to the /home partition (on a slow IDE disk - see below) rather than the higher performance RAID system that I used above.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can see how the transfer rate decays as it approaches the write capacity of the '/home' disk.

'bbcp' can recursively copy directories with the '-r' flag.  Like 'rsync', it first has to build a file list to send to the receiver, but unlike rsync, it doesn't tell you that it's doing that, so unless you use the '-D' (debug) flag, it looks like it has just hung.  The time required to build the file list is of course proportional to the complexity of the recursive directory scan.  It can also do incremental copies like 'rsync' with the '-a -k' flags, which also allow it to recover from failed transfers.

Note that bbcp is 'very slow' at copying deep directory trees of small files.  If you need to copy such trees, you should first tar up the trees and use bbcp to copy the tarball.  Such an approach will increase the transfer speed enormously.

[[namedpipes]]
The most recent version of bbcp can use the '-N' http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/bbcp.htm#_Toc305612710[named pipes option] to use external programs or pipes to feed the network stream. This allows you to specify an external program such as 'tar' to provide the data stream for bbcp.  Like this:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bbcp -P 2 -w 2M -s 10  -N io 'tar -cv -O /w2 ' remotehost:'tar -C /nffs/w2 -xf - '
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above command uses bbcp's named pipe option for both input and output (-N io) to take tar's output from STDOUT (tar's '-O' option), and using the abve-described options to stream the tar's output to bbcp to the remotehost where tar is invoked to decompose the bytestream and write it to the new location (-C /nffs/w2)

NB: the http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/#_Toc332986074[original bbcp help page] on this option has (as of May09,2013) a typo or 2.  The above example is correct and works.


NB: I have ocassionally seen this error when using bbcp:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
time bbcp -P 10 -w 2M -s 8 root@bduc-login.nacs.uci.edu:/home/testing.tar.gz .
bbcp: Accept timed out on port 5031
bbcp: Unable to allocate more than 0 of 8 data streams.
Killed by signal 15.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you get this error, add the "-z" option to your command line (right after bbcp). ie"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
time bbcp -z -P 10 -w 2M -s 8 root@bduc-login.nacs.uci.edu:/home/testing.tar.gz .

[[bbftp]]
bbftp
~~~~~
http://doc.in2p3.fr/bbftp/[bbftp] is a modification of the FTP protocol that enables you to open multiple simultaneous TCP streams to transfer data.  It therefore allows you to sometimes bypass per-TCP restrictions that result from badly configured intervening machines.

In order to use it, you 'll need a bbftp client and server.  Most places that recieve large amounts of data (SDSC, NCAR, other supercomputer centers, teragrid nodes) will already have a bbftp server running, but you can also compile and run the server yourself.

The more usual case is to run only the client.  It builds very easily on Linux with just the typical 'curl/untar, cd, ./configure, make, make install' dance:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl http://doc.in2p3.fr/bbftp/dist/bbftp-client-3.2.0.tar.gz |tar -xzvf -
$ cd bbftp-client-3.2.0/bbftpc/
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make -j3
$ sudo make install
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using bbftp is more complicated than the usual ftp client because it has its own syntax:

To send data to a server:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ bbftp -s -e 'put file.154M  /gpfs/mangalam/big.file' -u mangalam -p 10 -V tg-login1.sdsc.teragrid.org
Password:
>> COMMAND : put file.154M /gpfs/mangalam/big.file
<< OK
160923648 bytes send in 7.32 secs (2.15e+04 Kbytes/sec or 168 Mbits/s)


the arguments mean:
-s  use ssh encryption
-e  'local command'
-E  'remote command' (not used above, but often used to cd on the remote system)
-u  'user_login'
-p  # use # parallel TCP streams
-V  be verbose
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data was 'sent' at 21MB/s to SDSC thru 10 parallel TCP streams (but well below the peak bandwidth of about 90MB/s on a Gb network)

To get data from a server:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ bbftp -s -e 'get /gpfs/mangalam/big.file from.sdsc' -u mangalam -p 10 -V tg-login1.sdsc.teragrid.org
Password:
>> COMMAND : get /gpfs/mangalam/big.file from.sdsc
<< OK
160923648 bytes got in 3.46 secs (4.54e+04 Kbytes/sec or 354 Mbits/s)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was able to 'get' the data at 45MB/s, about half of the theoretical maximum.

As a comparison, because the remote reciever is running an old (2.4) kernel
which does not handle dynamic TCP window scaling, scp is only able to manage
2.2MB/s to this server:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ scp  file.154M mangalam@tg-login1.sdsc.teragrid.org:/gpfs/mangalam/junk
Password:
file.154M                                  100%  153MB   2.2MB/s   01:10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[lftp]]
lftp
~~~~
http://lftp.yar.ru/[lftp] is a simple but capable FTP replacement that can use
multiple TCP streams
like bbcp, resulting in better performance than vanilla FTP or other single
stream mechanisms like scp.
One restriction is that the multi-stream approach only works in 'get' mode,
so if you're trying to upload data ('put' mode), it works only as well as a
single stream approach.
It will also do mirroring so if you're trying to mirror an entire website or
file tree, it can do that, much like the 'wget -m -p <website_head>'.

In my testing over a 1Gb connection, 'lftp' was about 5%-10% slower than 'bbcp' on getting
data (same number of streams with cache cleared each time) and noticeably slower on sending data.
Both 'bbcp' and 'lftp' appear to be transferring to local cache and on transferring files smaller than the free RAM,
will spend several seconds after the transfer is supposedly complete in syncing the data to disk.

[[fdt]]
Fast Data Transfer (fdt)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://monalisa.cern.ch/FDT[Fast Data Transfer] is an application for moving data quickly writ in Java so it can theoretically run on any platform.  The performance results on the web page are very impressive, but in local tests, it was slower than bbcp and the startup time for Java (as well as its failure to work in 'scp' mode (couldn't find the 'fdt.jar', even tho it was in the *CLASSPATH*, required you to explicitly start the receiving FDT server (not hard - see below, but another step)) argue somewhat against it.

Starting the server is easy; it starts by default in server mode:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
java -jar ./fdt.jar
# usual Java verbosity omitted
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The client uses the same jarfile but a different syntax:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
java -jar ./fdt.jar -ss 1M -P 10 -c remotehost.domain.uci.edu  ~/file.633M  -d /userdata/hjm

# where
# -ss 1M  ..... sets the TCP SO_SND_BUFFER size to 1 MB
# -P 10 ....... uses 10 parallel streams (default is 1)
# -c host ..... defines the remote host
# -d dir ...... sets the remote dir
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The speed is certainly impressive.  Much more than scp:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# scp done over the same net, about the same time

$ scp file.4.2G  remotehost.domain.uci.edu:~
hjm@remotehost's password: ***********
 file.4.2G                   100% 4271MB  25.3MB/s   02:49
                                          ^^^^^^^^
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# using the default 1 stream:
$ java -jar fdt.jar -c remotehost.domain.uci.edu ../file.4.2G -d /userdata/hjm/
(transferred in 86s for *53MB/s*)

# with 10 streams and a larger buffer:
$ java -jar fdt.jar -P 10 -bs 1M -c remotehost.domain.uci.edu ../file.4.2G -d /userdata/hjm/
(transferred in 68s for *66MB/s* with 10 streams)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But fdt is slower than bbcp.  The following test was done at about the same time between the same hosts:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bbcp -P 10 -w 2M -s 10 file.4.2G hjm@remotehost.domain.uci.edu:/userdata/hjm/

[[gcm]]
Globus Connect & Globus Connect MultiUser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a fairly new (mid-2011) approach that claims to provide easy access to GridFTP-like speeds, reliable transfers, and 'No IT required'.  (At this point sysadmins will break into muffled snorts, the same response as 'seamless' provokes when applied to any computer-related activity.)  https://www.globusonline.org/globus_connect/[Globus Connect] and it's more ambitious https://www.globusonline.org/gcmu/[Globus Connect MultiUser] sibling is an attempt to make using the Globus mechanicals less horrific for users.  In this it largely succeeds from the users' POV - those who are already part of a Globus/Grid node and who have specific requirements to transfer TBs of data on a 'regular basis' and who have the endpoints set up for them.  Otherwise it's somewhat clunky since you have to explicitly set up endpoints beforehand and too complicated to set up unless you're Linux-enhanced (ie. you do ssh public key exchange, and globus MyProxy configs in your sleep, ).

That said, the process to install the software to your add yourself to the system is fairly straightforward. https://www.globusonline.org/globus_connect/[Just follow the instructions for the different platforms.]

The problem with this approach is that it's a large amount of work for a small amount of advantage relative to link:#bbcp[bbcp].  However, the 'Multiuser' version allows all the users of a server or cluster to take advantage of this protocol with no additional effort, a better tradeoff between effort expended and advantages conferred.

The instructions for installing the 'Multiuser' version are a little more elaborate.  Herewith, their own https://www.globusonline.org/gcmu/[devilish details for a sysadmin setting up the 'Globus Connect MultiUser'] (Linux-only so far).



[[gridftp]]
GridFTP
~~~~~~~
If you and your colleagues have to transfer data in the range of multiple GBs and you have to do it regularly, it's probably worth setting up a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GridFTP[GridFTP] site.  Because it allows multipoint, multi-stream TCP connections, it can transfer data at multiple GB/s.  However, it's beyond the scope of this simple doc to describe its setup and use, so if this sounds useful, bother your local network guru/sysadmin.


[[globusonline]]
Globus Online
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
https://www.globusonline.org/[Globus Online] is grid technology that has been wrapped in a web interface to enable mere humans to use the capabilities of the GRIDFTP system to transfer very large amounts of data very quickly between nodes that are part of this system.  The tagline is 'Move files fast No IT required'. The advantages are that when it's set up, it works very well.  The disadvantages are that the 'No IT required' part is at this point, fairly optimistic and that it will only work between registered sites (which you can add with the https://www.globusonline.org/globus_connect/[Globus Connect process], so it's not very useful for ad hoc file transfers.


However, if you have a set of endpoints that frequently need to transfer large amounts of data, this approach would be very useful. Especially if you run a cluster or other multi-user system, there is an associated utility called https://www.globusonline.org/gcmu[Globus Connect Multi-User] which will allow all users of registered endpoint to use the Globus transfer capabilities.

While it is out of beta as of this writing (June 10th, 2014), the setup is quite complex, oddly documented (lots of it, information-sparse) and lacking simple examples so enabling it may take some additional emails and even phone calls.  An example is that the documentation never defines authentication mechanisms and confuses 'domains' and 'hostnames', the distinction between which you would think an org like globus would be clear.  Possibly some of this confusion is sown by the use of globus terminology, which is subtly different than that used by sysadmins (me).

I presume it will be getting progressively easier to use as time passes.

The process for setting it up on your endpooint is described on the site, but it may be worthwhile describing the general overview which can be confusing. UCLA's IDRE also has a http://hpc.ucla.edu/hoffman2/file-transfer/gol.php[setup description] (Thanks, Prakashan.)

*Snarky Point of Contention:* The documentation overuses the word 'seamlessly' which all computer users realizes is a contraction for 'seamlessly if nothing goes wrong and your setup is exactly like mine and monkeys fly out my butt'. YMMV.

*Using the Globus Connect system requires you to:*

- *https://www.globusonline.org/SignUp[Register a username with Globus Online].*  This ID will be used to identify you to the Globus system. It is not related to your username on any hosts you may want to use as endpoints.

- *https://www.globusonline.org/xfer/ManageEndpoints?globus_connect=true[Register connection endpoints]* that 'you' will want to send to or receive from.  You must of course have a *user* account on these machines to use them and it helps if you have admin privs on these machines to install the necessary software (see next point).  You will have to name your endpoints a combination of your Globus ID and a machine name.  It doesn't have to be the hostname of the client, but that will help to identify it later.  You will also have to generate a machine ID string that looks like *d9g89270-74ab-4382-beb1-d2882628952a*. This ID will have to be used to start the 'globusconnect' process on the client before you can start a transfer.  https://support.globusonline.org/entries/23881557[See the Linux section (for example) of the main page].

- *https://support.globusonline.org/home[Install the necessary software]* on the endpoint (client) machines.  There are different packages for different clients.  You (or your sysadmin) must install the repository info, and then the software itself. This is semi-automated via platform-specific apps see the 'Globus Connect Downloads' in the link above.  There are 60-plus packages that make up a Globus client; thank god it's done automatically.  If you want to do it manually, the https://support.globusonline.org/entries/24078973[process for doing so is described here], but I'd recommend trying the automatic installation first.

- *Start the Globus Connect process* on the client via the downloaded client software.  On Linux, it is provided in the http://connect.globusonline.org/linux/stable/globusconnect-latest.tgz[globusconnect-latest.tgz], which unpacks to provide both 32bit and 64bit clients, as well as the top-level bash script 'globusconnect' to start the relevant version.  Running 'globusconnect-X.x/globusconnect' will enable the clients to see each other and now, finally you can...

- *https://www.globusonline.org/xfer/StartTransfer[Start a Data Transfer]* by opening the previous link and identifying the nodes you want to transfer between.  After that, it's as easy as using graphical FTP client.  Populate the panes with the directories you want to transfer and click on the directional arrow to initiate the transfer.

I've gotten 40-50MB/s between UCI and the Broad Institute depending on time of day, system load, and phase of moon.


[[netcat]]
netcat
~~~~~~
http://netcat.sourceforge.net/[netcat] (aka 'nc') is installed by default on most Linux and MacOSX systems.  It provides a way of opening TCP or UDP network connections between nodes, acting as an open pipe thru which you can send any data as fast as the connection will allow, imposing no additional protocol load on the transfer. Because of its widespread availability and it's speed, it can be used to transmit data between 2 points relatively quickly, especially if the data doesn't need to be encrypted or compressed (or if it already is).

However, to use netcat, you have to have login privs on both ends of the connection and you need to explicitly set up a 'listener' that waits for a connection request on a specific port from the receiver.  This is less convenient to do than simply initiating an 'scp' or 'rsync' connection from one end, but may be worth the effort if the size of the data transfer is very large. To monitor the transfer, you also have to use something like 'pv' (pipeviewer); netcat itself is quite laconic.

How it works: On one end (the sending end, in this case), you need to set up a listening port:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[send_host]: $ pv -pet honkin.big.file | nc -q 1 -l 1234 <enter>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This sends the 'honkin.big.file' thru 'pv -pet' which will display  progress, ETA, and time taken.  The command will hang, listening (-l) for a connection from the other end.  The '-q 1' option tells the sender to wait 1s after getting the EOF and then quit.

On the receiving end, you connect to the nc listener
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[receive_host] $ nc sender.net.uci.edu 1234 |pv -b > honkin.big.file <enter>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(note: no '-p' to indicate port on the receiving side).  The '-b' option to 'pv' shows only bytes received.

Once the receive_host command is inititated, the transfer starts, as can be seen by the pv output on the sending side and the bytecount on the receiving side.  When it finishes, both sides terminate the connection 1s after getting the EOF.

This arrangement is slightly arcane, but supports the unix tools philosophy which allows you to chain various small tools together to perform a task.  While the above example shows the case for a single large file, it can also be modified only slightly to do recursive transfers, using tar, shown here recursively copying the local 'sge' directory to the remote host.

[[tarnetcat]]
tar and netcat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The combination of these 2 crusty relics from the stone age of Unix are remarkably effective for moving data if you don't need encryption.  Since they impose very little protocol overhead to the data, the transfer can run at close to wire speed for large files.  Compression can be added with the 'tar' options of '-z (gzip) or '-j (bzip2)'.

The setup is not as trivial as 'rsync, scp, or bbcp', since it requires commands to be issued at both ends of the connection, but for large transfers, the speed payoff is non-trivial.  For example, using a single rsync on a 10Gb private connection, we were getting only about 30MB/s, mostly because of many tiny files.  Using tar/netcat, the average speed went up to about 100MB/s.  And using multiple tar/netcat combinations to move specific subdirs, we were able to get an average of 500GB/hr, still not great (~14% of theoretical max), but about 5x better than rsync alone.

Note that you can set up the 'listener' on either side.  In this example, I've set the listener to the receiving side.

In the following example, the receiver is 10.255.78.10; the sender is 10.255.78.2.

First start the listener waiting on port '12378', which will accept the byte-stream and untar it, decompressing as it comes in.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[receive_host] $ nc -l  -p  port_#  | tar -xzf -
#eg
               $ nc -l  -p  12378   | tar -xzf -

# when the command is issued, the prompt hangs, waiting for the sender to start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then kick off the transfer on the sending side.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[send_host]: $ tar -czvf - dir_target   | nc -s  sender       receiver      port_#
# eg
             $ tar -czvf - fmri_classic | nc -s  10.255.78.2  10.255.78.10  12378
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case, I've added the verbose flag (-v) to the tar command on the sender side so using 'pv' is redundant.  It also uses tar's built-in compression flag (-z) to compress as it transmits.  Depending on the bandwidth available to you and the CPUs of the hosts, this may actually 'slow' transmission. As noted above, it's most effective on bandwidth-limited channels.

You could also bundle the 2 together in a script, using ssh to execute the remote command. etc, etc, etc, etc.

[[aspera]]
Aspera ascp
~~~~~~~~~~~
*Updated Jan 06, 2015*
After a licensing problem with the existing Broad Globus system stopped us 
from using the https://www.globus.org/[browser-based Globus system] to finish the 
transfer, we still 
had to transfer about 30TB of data from the Broad Inst to UCI.  We tried using the
link:#bbcp[above mentioned 'bbcp'] from there to here, but since I controlled only one side of 
the connection, I couldn't tune the transfer to provide more than about 1-3MB/s.
The Broad people mentioned that the data was available via 
http://asperasoft.com/[Aspera], and I grouchily agreed to try it again (see first 
review below) via the Linux commandline client 'ascp' that had proved so 
trying previously.

This time, tho (I had full docs for the client and some experience) it started up 
and immediately provided a consistent 30-40MB/s over the same network path that 
I was using with 'bbcp'.  A tremendous, *startling* improvement over the default 'bbcp' parameters, 
especially since it 'was' the *same network path* over which 'bbcp' was providing about 1/10th the
bandwidth.  Whether it's due to autotuning of window size and streams, or some other 
internal magic, I can't say.  And I also can't say whether (with control of both 
endpoints) I could have coerced 'bbcp' to attain a similar bandwidth since I have seen bbcp
do longhaul bandwidths of this magnitude.  But seeing 'ascp' immediately provide this magnitude of
bandwidth, with no user-side tuning is very impressive indeed.

I'll leave the previous notation in place to show how much ascp has improved.

*first post, 2013*
Aspera is a commercial company (recently bought by IBM) whose aim is to monetize 
large scale data transfer across networks. I have no experience with their Windows 
and Mac clients which may be very good, but their default Linux client, 
http://betascience.blogspot.com/2010/02/using-aspera-instead-of-ftp-to-download.html[starting 
about 3years ago] is not.  Or to be more specific:  It can work well, but it may 
well require a lot of tweaking and adjustment to work well.  God knows, I had to.  
However, I was 'eventually' able to transfer 15TB across the UC with the Linux 
client, which after the aforementioned tweaking worked ok.

Compared to the above-mentioned link:#bbcp[bbcp], or the consumer-skinned and 
smoothed https://www.globus.org/[Globus Online], the Aspera Linux client 
is still crude, difficult to use, poorly documented, and fails repeatedly. 
I posted some comments to the blog linked above, but here are my suggestions 
about its use when you can't use an alternative approach.

When I say that the Linux client is poorly documented, it doesn't mean that there 
is no documentation.  It means that it is hard to find (no helpful links returned 
by the search service on their support page),  
http://download.asperasoft.com/download/docs/ascp/2.7/html/index.html[the Documentation 
(click ascp Usage)] is no better than most free software, and that the 
http://download.asperasoft.com/download/docs/ascp/2.7/html/index.html[Examples 
(click ascp General Examples)] are fairly sparse.  Additionally, the customer 
support databases are behind an firewall and are therefore beyond the reach of 
google. This is certainly Aspera's right, but it means self-help is essentially impossible.

I will say that opening a support ticket brought rapid (<1 hour from filing the 
ticket to a human response), and knowledgeable assistance. (Thanks, Bill!).  
ascp will fill your syslog with a ton of event logs which, if sent to Aspera, 
will probably allow them to debug the problem.

A non-Aspera employee advised me to use ascp's parallel copy to speed up the 
transfer but that was apparently a mistake since that option (tho it appears to 
work) is usually only useful when the client node is CPU-bound (mine wasn't) and 
neither increases overall copy speeds, nor allows you to restart failed transfers 
(and one of the parallel copies would fail every few minutes, possibly due to 
the timing issue noted below.)
Since I was not able to get the parallel approach to work reliably for more than 
30 min at a time, the best approach was to start a single serial process with 
the Linux ascp client after carefully reading the above blog post and correcting 
the command as per your needs.

Also, ascp can be very sensitive to timing issues so a modification may have to 
be made to the configuration file:

So, once that issue was settled, and I stopped trying to parallel copy, the following 
command worked reliably, maintaining the copy for at least a couple of days until the 
transfer finished.  The transfer was not magically faster than what I would have seen 
via bbcp, and was considerably slower than a GridFTP transfer, but it did work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/path/to/ascp  -QT -l 500M -k1 user@remote.source.org:/remote/path /local/path
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
where:

* '-QT' 'Q' enables fair transfer policy, 'T' DISables encryption.
* '-l 500m' sets the target transfer rate at 500Mbits/s.  This depends on what your connection to the Internet allows and especially what other operations are happening with the interface.  ascp seems to be very sensitive to this option and may well crash if it is exceeded.
* '-k1' enables resuming partially transferred files, where the options are (From docs:)
  - 0: Always retransfer the entire file.
  - 1: Check file attributes and resume if the current and original attributes match. (This is probably good enough for most ppl and is MUCH faster than -k2)
  - 2: Check file attributes and do a sparse file checksum; resume if the current and original attributes/checksums match.
  - 3: Check file attributes and do a full file checksum; resume if the current and original attributes/checksums match.

Again,  http://download.asperasoft.com/download/docs/ascp/2.7/html/index.html[read the docs carefully] since the error messages are unhelpful.
